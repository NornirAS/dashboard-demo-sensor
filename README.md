# [Dashboard demo sensor](https://norniras.github.io/dashboard-demo-sensor/)

This is the second part of the dashboard demo. There is a simple form on the page which has fields for token, ghostID and two sliders which will act as temperature and humidity measurements. Each client will represent a sensor in **Dashboard demo** and people can be part of the demo.
 
Each active participant will be given a token and ghostID. Then they can move sliders to change the temperature and humidity value and when the "Send Data" button is pressed, data will be available on the dashboard.
